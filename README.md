# Handwritten number recognition: a TinyML application using TFLM

[Tensorflow Lite for Micrcontroller](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) (TFLM) is a framework that is a subset of Tensorflow which is designed to execute machine learning model on resources constrained devices i.e. microcontrollers.

The following repository will provide anyone having a [STM32F429I-DISC1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) the ability of executing this TinyML application which is: 

A model train with The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database which could make the inference on the number drawn on the LCD. From 0 to 9.
